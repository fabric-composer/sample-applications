# Hyperledger Composer Sample Applications

The repository contains sample applications written against the [Hyperledger Composer](https://github.com/hyperledger/composer) [client and admin APIs](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/jsdoc/index.html). 

Currently this contains the code and scripts for the ['Getting Started'](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/installing/quickstart.html) tutorial.

We welcome Pull Requests for new applications - please see the [contributing notes](https://github.com/hyperledger/composer/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). 

*IMPORTANT NOTE*  The Getting Started application is the main route for people to get started with Hyperledger Composer - please exercise care when changing it!
